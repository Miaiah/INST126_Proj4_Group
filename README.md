# Maryland COVID-19 Data Analysis and Visualization

# As COVID-19 is the most crucial disaster and catastrophe we are facing worldwide right now, we think it is extremely important for us, as well as everyone around us, to understand how critical the situation actually is. Our goals for this project are to summarize and analyze COVID-19 trends in the state of Maryland and compare them by county.
