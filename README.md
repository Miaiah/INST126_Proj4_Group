# Maryland COVID-19 Data Analysis and Visualization by County

##### As COVID-19 is the most crucial disaster and catastrophe that we are currently facing worldwide, we think that it is extremely important for us, as well as everyone around us, to understand how critical the situation actually is. Our goals for this project are to summarize and analyze COVID-19 trends in the state of Maryland and compare them by County.

##### There are multiple open source datasets that we have found online, including a dataset containing COVID-19 cases in each Maryland County everyday and a 2019 dataset showing race trends in each Maryland County, that will aid us in analyzing COVID-19 trends in the state of Maryland.
